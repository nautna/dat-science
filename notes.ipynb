    "### Pros:\n",
    "#### Linear Regression\n",
    "- simple to understand\n",
    "- workhorse for predicting/modeling continuous outcomes\n",
    "- good for exploratory analysis (determining statistical significance):\n",
    " 1. p-values\n",
    " 2. degree of fit\n",
    " 3. F values\n",
    " \n",
    "#### KNN (classifier)\n",
    "- super simple\n",
    "- good for multiple classes (non-binary target variable)\n",
    "- quick to train\n",
    "- handles complexity well (weird boundaries are handled well; don't need high-order polynomial to fit)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression (classifier)\n",
    "- yields probability of predictions\n",
    "- relatively fast to train\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "#### Linear Regression\n",
    "- overfitting (too many features or too many high order terms)\n",
    "- requires normally distributed data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### KNN\n",
    "- doesn't always tell you probabilities\n",
    "- have to choose k\n",
    "- sensitive to noise\n",
    "- prediction can be slow for large datasets\n",
    "- no closed form definition of boundary (e.g. equation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression\n",
    "- hard to handle complexity (actually fitting a function)\n",
    "- can overfit if too many features\n",
